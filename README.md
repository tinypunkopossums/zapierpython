Zapier python code to parse nested json raw data set

Hi and thanks for reading, this is a project where I'm trying to parse a raw nested json data set into 19 different columns, each array has 19 data pieces including blanks being pulled from an API, and each array is eventually going to be mapped to an excel spreadsheet or google sheets etc, as a row.
